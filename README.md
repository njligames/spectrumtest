* Listed in the document: `CharterCodeChallenge2022.docx`

## How to Setup
I ran and developed by using the (bslint)[https://github.com/rokucommunity/bslint] tool in (Visual Studio Code)[https://code.visualstudio.com/download] with the Brightscript plugin installed. 

## How to Run

### Comments
* Although I did not test the app on all screen sizes, I wrote the layout so that will respond to the different scren sizes.
